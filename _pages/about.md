<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a second-year PhD student in Applied Mathematics, in particular mathematical optimization. My topic is the aggregate of flexibilities in long-term unit commitment problems, applying tools from operations research and mean-field theory to understand and improve current aggregation techniques in the use cases of electric vehicles and hydro installations. 

I am currently affiliated to EDF R&D, OSIRIS department, as well as the GHOST (Grenoble) and TROPICAL (Saclay) Inria teams.
